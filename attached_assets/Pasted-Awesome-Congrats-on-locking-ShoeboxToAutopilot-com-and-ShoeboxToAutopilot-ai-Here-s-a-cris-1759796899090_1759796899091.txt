Awesome. Congrats on locking **ShoeboxToAutopilot.com** and **ShoeboxToAutopilot.ai**. Here’s a crisp, go-to-market package you can use immediately. I’ll expand abbreviations on first use (then use abbreviations thereafter) and give you one clear “best path” with minimal extras.

# 1) Positioning & ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

**Positioning (one line):**
*Turn a bag of bills into a set-and-forget money system—fast.*

**Category:** Personal Finance Operations (PFO) — not investment management.

**Unique mechanism:**

* **Cashflow Foundation Workbook (CFW)** calculates a safe monthly **EXTRA**.
* **Avalanche Autopilot (AA)** allocates that EXTRA to kill debt fastest.
* **Biller-level autopay** hardens the system so it runs with minimal effort.
* Optional **Local Model (LM) Studio** creates a private monthly “Judge’s Financial Brief” (offline).

**Primary ICP:**

* Busy earners (30–65), solo or couples, steady income ($70k–$250k household), juggling 3–10 debts (cards/auto/personal). Overwhelmed by paper, want **hands-off** help, privacy-aware.

**Secondary ICP:**

* Small business owners/1099 pros with mixed personal/business bills who need a reliable system.

**Anti-ICP:**

* Day-traders/HNW seeking investing advice, anyone unwilling to use autopay, people expecting credit-repair/legal services.

**Top pains → promises:**

* *“It’s a mess.”* → **Shoebox-to-Dashboard in 10 days** (operational, not financial, promise).
* *“What’s safe to pay extra?”* → **CFW computes a Safe Monthly EXTRA.**
* *“I can’t keep up.”* → **Autopay-first** + AA monthly rhythm.
